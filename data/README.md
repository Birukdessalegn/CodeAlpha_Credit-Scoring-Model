# Dataset Information for Credit Scoring Model

## Source
The dataset used in this project is sourced from [insert source here, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, etc.]. It contains information related to loan applications and borrower characteristics.

## Structure
The dataset consists of the following columns:
- **Column1**: Description of Column1
- **Column2**: Description of Column2
- **Column3**: Description of Column3
- **...**: ...

## Preprocessing Steps
Before using the dataset for model training, the following preprocessing steps are necessary:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Remove any duplicate entries and handle inconsistencies in the data.
2. **Missing Values**: Identify and impute or remove missing values as appropriate.
3. **Feature Encoding**: Convert categorical variables into numerical format using techniques such as one-hot encoding or label encoding.
4. **Normalization/Standardization**: Scale numerical features to ensure they contribute equally to model training.

Please ensure that these steps are followed to maintain the integrity of the dataset and improve model performance.
